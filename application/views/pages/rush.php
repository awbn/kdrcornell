		<p>With Spring Rush 2013 just around the corner, it's time to start thinking about Greek Life!  From Monday, January 14th to Sunday, January 20th, hundreds of students will return from winter break a week early to participate in Cornell's Rush Week.  This is a week that we at Kappa Delta Rho look forward to every year.  Rush Week is packed with fun events designed to allow us to get to know each interested student, and for you (the student) to find the house which is right for you.  You can find information specific to rushing &Kappa;&Delta;&Rho; below, or you may find more general information about Cornell Fraternity life and recruitment at <a href="http://dos.cornell.edu/greek/info_for_students/index.cfm">Cornell's Greek Life page</a>.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact President Michael Paull at <a href="mailto:mlp222@cornell.edu">mlp222@cornell.edu</a>. We hope to see you come January 17th!</p>

		<h3>Meals at the House</h3>
		<p>Our sit-down family-style dinners are a very important part of our chapter.  It's a time where we can catch up with each other while enjoying good food from our excellent chef and honorary brother Phil LaRocca.  We hope that you will be able to join us for at least one (if not all) dinner during the week.<!--</p><p><em>Tuesday, 6pm</em>: Chicken Parmesan (a &Kappa;&Delta;&Rho; favorite!)</p><p><em>Wednesday, 6pm</em>: Bourbon Chicken</p><p><em>Thursday, 6pm</em>: Tapas Night</p><p><em>Friday, 6pm</em>: Steak Pizzaiola</p><p><em>Saturday, 6pm</em>: Flank Steak</p>-->

		<h3>Videos and Pictures</h3>
		<p>Curious about what goes on at the house?  We've put up some videos and pictures of the brothers and of some of the events that we throw.  To view these, please visit <a href="<?php echo URL::site("multimedia")?>">our multimedia page</a>.</p>

		<h3>For Parents</h3>
		<p>We realize that Rush Week has, in the past, had a bad reputation for being a wild "party" week - and there are probably some concerns that even with this year being ostensibly dry, some houses will try to break the rules.  At KDR, we've always firmly maintained that alcohol is not necessary for someone to enjoy our events, and as such we will be following the new University and Inter-Fraternity Council policies regarding alcohol to the letter.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact our President, Michael, at <a href="mailto:mlp222@cornell.edu">mlp222@cornell.edu</a> or our Rush Chairman, Demitri, at <a href="mailto:dd394@cornell.edu">dd394@cornell.edu</a>.</p>
